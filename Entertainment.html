 <p> New dance style, currently sweeping Tiktok and dominating dance floors across the country, has taken Kenya by storm,<br> with many impressed by it's simplistic moves and some disturbed by it's sinister connotations.
The dance style, which, as usual, emerged from the backstreets of Eastlands<br> and quickly made it's way online, is dubbed "Mapangale" - a street corruption of the Swahili word for a machete, 'Panga'.</p>

<p>The style involves two dancers dancing while facing each other - as they move and wiggle, they also lower themselves rhythmically, and,<br> while using their arms, they mimic the acts of someone cutting up their dance partner with a panga.
 One can also pull off the dance by themselves;<br> you only need to adhere to the up and down motions as you pretend to cut yourself up, right from the neck, down to the shoulders and around the torso.</p>

<p>Videos of the dance style flooded Tiktok over the weekend, with some of the biggest names on Kenyan Tiktok <br>jumping on the fad and helping propel it's irrepressible notoriety.</p> <img src="mapangale.jpg"width="550"><br><p>

According to official records from Tiktok, the sound behind the dance style was invented by popular Reggae MC Zendiambo, <br>who, in a snippet of the song to which dancers are participating, can be heard saying, "Mapangale... Mapangale..." repeatedly.<br>

Some content creators on Tiktok have now even gone a step further and are using an actual panga to demonstrate their dance styles -<br> some are recording videos of themselves dancing to the song in supermarkets, where they're seen brandishing brand new pangas picked up from the store's shelves.</p>

<p>

Various big names in the Tiktok dance community have already started sharing videos of themselves doing the challenge. <br>Popular dance influencer Kabuda as well as comedians Mulamwah, Terence Creative and DJ Shiti have also been captured in videos enjoying the dance.<br>

Kenyans on X have also welcomed the dance - albeit with differing opinions.</p><p>
While some feel like Kenyans badly needed a new dance style (the last popular one was 'Anguka Nayo' several months ago)<br> some others have found the style morbidly disturbing as it involves the acts of 'cutting yourself or someone up' with a panga.<br>

Those against the dance style have pointed out the proliferation of femicide cases across the country, with many expressing their unease at enjoying a dance which reminds them of killings and brutal murders.<br></p><p>

"A woman is getting killed almost each day in Kenya and the youth are now blindly dancing along to a sound called 'Mapangale' while also pretending to cut up anyone around the dance floor. Isn't that disturbing? <br>I shudder at what this dance could encourage people to do!" Mary Wanjau, an X user, said.</p>

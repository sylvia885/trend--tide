The head of state appealed to Kenyans to join the campaign and play a role by sensitising the community on gender based violence. <br>

"I urge every Kenyan to join this movement. Parents have a crucial role. I say so as a parent of four girls myself. Be present and approachable to your children.<br> A strong family is the first line of defence against the dangers lurking in the society," the president pointed out.</p>
